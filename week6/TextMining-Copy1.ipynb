       " ' and Simulations (ES) in an effort to identify critical aspects related to teaching and learning with these tools. \\n3. Historical development of SGs and SEGs \\nHistorically',\n",
       " ' a problem within the gaming industry has been a lack of hardware development (processing power',\n",
       " ' graphic rendering',\n",
       " ' and interface development) that enables the realistic settings and graphics',\n",
       " ' tool interactions',\n",
       " ' and tasks to effectively create realistic educational games beyond a discrete simulation. Many of these limitations changed during the 2000s when indi-vidual processing power reached a suf.cient level to make realistic three-dimensional (3-D) renderings of environments possible. This increase in processing power coincided with new memory formats that allowed the average user to have access to unprecedented quantities of computer memory that enabled more open-ended immersive gaming to occur thus the basic components of SGs and SEGs became possible. These new learning environments focused on all levels of teaching and learning and were immediate pre-decessors to Serious Games and later Serious Educational Games (Annetta',\n",
       " ' \\nFolta',\n",
       " ' \\n& \\nKlesath',\n",
       " \" \\n2010). \\nIncrease realism and associated interactive capabilities enabled groups such as the United States Army to release a game titled America's Army in 2002 for the purposes of recruitment and mar-keting. To describe these new genera of games\",\n",
       " ' Zyda \\n(2005)',\n",
       " ' coined the term Computerized Serious Games (Apperley',\n",
       " \" \\n2006). The release of the Army's Serious Game\",\n",
       " \" in conjunction with the Woodrow \\n\\nR.L. Lamb et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 80 (2018) 158e167 \\nWilson Center's introduction of the Serious Games Initiative\",\n",
       " ' created the impetus within the educational sector to develop video games for more than just entertainment. These actions decidedly placed the term Serious Game into the forefront of the educational tech-nology discussions. Military research into the use of Serious Games continues in multiple places such as the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base with the 711th Human Performance Wing and Fort Sam Houston as a part of the War.ghter Readiness Research Division Immersive Environments. \\nIn 2004',\n",
       " ' Annetta collaborated with other researcher-educators to add the pedagogical and learning aspects to SGs thus trans-forming SGs to SEGs (Annetta \\n& Shymansky',\n",
       " ' \\n2006). Lamb \\n(2013) \\nlater developed assessment models for integration into Serious Educational Games increasing their usability as classroom tools. This particular branch of educational gaming or game based learning',\n",

       " ' and or skill based growth; not just change in isolated skills alone (Breuer \\n& \\nBente',\n",
       " ' \\n2010). From the fringes of educational technology',\n",
       " ' the term and conceptions of what a Serious Educational Games is has matured. Through the maturation of the games within the literature',\n",
       " ' the term (Serious Educational Games) more recently has become more speci.c; referring to games designed to run on per-sonal computers or video game consoles (Annetta',\n",
       " ' \\n2010). This is another speci.c difference between Serious Games',\n",
       " ' Serious Educational Games',\n",
       " ' and Educational Simulations in that Serious Games and many Educational Simulations require larger more robust computer platforms due to computational requirements making them out of reach for many primary and secondary educational institutions. \\n4. What is a simulation (ES)? \\nSimulations in education are a group of technologies supporting highly engaging',\n",
       " ' often two-dimensional',\n",
       " ' interactive virtual envi-ronments between limited variables. Simulations mimic real life situations or processes as a limited model for manipulation and examination of the relationships between interacting variables (Kunkler',\n",
       " ' \\n2006). Simulations provide the user the opportunity to interact at almost any scale or environment regardless of the feasibility in the real world. In the case of a simulation',\n",
       " ' the enter-tainment is simply a byproduct of the actions and not necessarily the intention of the designers. The singular simpli.ed two-dimensional closed nature modeling is the critical de.ning aspect of a simulation (ES) studies in this analysis. \\n5. How simulations differ from a video game \\nGiven the wide variety of video games available',\n",
       " ' a critical question is how a video game',\n",
       " ' in the general sense',\n",
       " \" differs from a simulation. To answer this one must .rst understand the aspects that make up a game. A game has multiple features and qualities that are universal to all forms of games including video games. Games have the following characteristics: \\n(1) \\nEmotional attachment to the outcome of the actions taken by the player; \\n\\n(2) \\nA uniform set of rules governing the actions players take; \\n\\n(3) \\nDifferential outcomes related to actions taken by players during play; \\n\\n(4) \\nDifferentiation of value for actions taken by players; \\n\\n(5) \\nConsequential actions resulting from actions the players take; \\n\\n(6) \\nAgents within the game for the player's characteristics to act upon. \\n\\n\\n\\nThis generalized description of a game applies to any game including video games. The differentiation of the video game from other forms of games occurs through the inclusion of electronic components such as input devices (keyboard or joystick) and output devices (computer screen or television) that mediate the six characteristics above (Mitchell \\n& \\nSavill-Smith\",\n",
       " ' \\n2004). In this un-derstanding',\n",
       " ' a simulation has many characteristics in common with a video game',\n",
       " ' in that a simulation is designed to model real systems as closely as possible (Walker',\n",
       " ' \\nGiddings',\n",
       " ' \\n& Armstrong',\n",
       " ' \\n2011). For example',\n",
       " ' the Lunar Lander1 \\ngame is a Moon landing simulation. This is in contrast to a SEG in an SG',\n",
       " ' where the designers attempt to model all aspects of the complexity of the system to include the three dimensional nature of the system. SEGs also depart from simulations and SG though the addition of story as a means to drive game mechanics. \\n6. Model of student learning \\nTo fully appreciate the role that educational gaming can play in learning it is important to understand how the authors de.ne student learning. Educational and psychological literature tends to focus on only one narrow aspect of learning when discussing research. Speci.cally',\n",
       " ' researchers arti.cially separate learning into three areas: affect',\n",
       " ' behavior',\n",
       " ' and cognition (Mazur',\n",
       " ' \\n2015). Thus',\n",
       " ' when examining the role of one of these three components of learning on student outcomes there is little consideration on how each of the areas interact with the other as antecedents or subse-quent dispositions. More importantly',\n",
       " ' there is little direct com-parison of how different forms of technology interact to change learning. Current trends in educational measurement and psycho-metrics using educational games have begun to address the arti.-cial disconnect that exists between affect',\n",
       " ' cognition',\n",
       " ' and content outcomes and allow educators a means to assess all three areas simultaneously (Young \\net \\nal.',\n",
       " ' \\n2012). This is of critical importance because of the linkage between affect (attitudes) and orientation toward learning (Slavin',\n",
       " ' \\n2011). \\nThe intersection of cognition',\n",
       " ' behavior',\n",
       " ' and affect was initially introduced by Berkowitz',\n",

Knowledge construction \\nThe construction of knowledge in a virtual environment is comparable to the construction of knowledge in an analogue environment (i.e. the real world). This is because humans construct and use knowledge to identify and understand critical processes regardless of the environment in which they .nd themselves (Weick',\n",
       " ' \\nSutcliffe',\n",

Speci.cally the identi.cation of patterns of cognitive processes used by video game players in multiple domains is of critical signi.cance to the education and psychology community. The primary assumption related to learning using video games is that when exposing a student to low stakes computer environments',\n",

Why games are so engaging in the classroom \\nEducational games are designed speci.cally to take advantage of the engaging nature of video games through the bridging of cognition and psychological reward systems. This occurs through stimulation of the areas of the brain associated with attention and arousal (Schore',\n",

Moderator descriptions \\n14.1. Affect \\nEmotion is a key component of psychological and educational understandings relating outcomes to cognition and achievement. Empirical studies in psychology and education',\n",
       " ' among other .elds',\n",
       " ' have done a great deal of work to characterize and de.ne affect and its role in perception and understanding in learning. Speci.cally',\n",
       " ' affect or emotions anchor and shape beliefs and perceptions and are intricately intertwined with cognition and behavior. Affect is developed and explored at the individual level of the phenomenon. Within this study',\n",
       " ' there are a number of affective characteristics',\n",

       " ' sensation',\n",
       " ' motivation',\n",
       " ' and self-ef.cacy. \\n14.2. Engagement \\nEngagement within the context of this study derives from psy-chological immersion within the SG',\n",
       " ' SEG',\n",
       " ' and ES. More speci.cally',\n",
       " ' the type of engagement often experienced by players within the context of these modes is referred to as Flow (Csikszentmihalyi',\n",
       " ' \\n1997). Flow is a highly energized state of concentration and focus often allowing one to shut-out distractions (Annetta',\n",
       " ' \\nLamb',\n",
       " ' \\nBowling \\n& Cheng',\n",
       " \" \\n2011). Flow is further characterized as a psy-chological state one enters while deeply engaged with experiential immersive interactive learning environments that hold one's attention for an extended period of time (Paine\",\n",
       " ' \\n2007). \\n14.3. Motivation \\nMotivation is a more generalized construct consisting of inter-est',\n",
       " ' self-ef.cacy',\n",
       " ' and other related constructs (Usher',\n",
       " ' \\n2012). Moti-vation is divided into two facets',\n",
       " ' intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is characterized by behaviors in which people actively engage in activities that interest them without the necessity of reward. Extrinsic motivation is characterized by behaviors that are performed not because of interest but because of a concrete or perceived consequence or reward. Motivation within the context of SEG',\n",
       " ' SG',\n",
       " ' and ES arises from a desire to complete required tasks and solve problems to progress the game. \\nR.L. Lamb et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 80 (2018) 158e167 \\n14.4. Self-ef.cacy \\nPsychologists consider self-ef.cacy',\n",
       " ' along with interest',\n",
       " ' as part of an area of psychology concerned with self-referent thought and its relation to psychological functioning (Bandura',\n",
       " ' \\n1982). Psycho-metricians and measurements experts suggest that measurement of self-referent constructs',\n",
       " ' such as self-ef.cacy',\n",
       " ' can most readily be accomplished via self-reporting measures',\n",
       " ' as the constructs are internal and latent (Lamb \\net \\nal.',\n",
       " ' \\n2012). Completion of virtual task and mastery of content within the virtual environment can lead to increases in ones self-ef.cacy within the real world (Hardin',\n",
       " ' \\nLooney',\n",
       " ' \\n& Fuller',\n",

       " ' and behavioral skills inte-grated into coherent psychological heuristics for reactionary approaches. The four general components affecting self-ef.cacy are personal belief',\n",

       " ' mastery experiences',\n",
       " ' and peer success (Bandura',\n",
       " ' \\n1977) \\n\\n14.5. Cognition \\nIndividual human cognition is a means to embody a set of processes and mechanisms by which an individual understands the world though thinking and problem solving (Zimmerman \\n& Croker',\n",
       " ' \\n2014). General cognition is a combination of several cognitive at-tributes activated in parallel and simultaneously. This process of understanding has in some ways led to an arti.cial separation be-tween the knowing and doing (Hotton \\n& Yoshimi',\n",
       " \" \\n2011). One-way to bridge this separation between knowing and doing is with the use of authentic tasks. Authenticity is a key feature of learning and by extension learning in the virtual environment. The linkage be-tween the structure of the activity and the authenticity of the task demands that one's cognition situate into the context of the learning environment. These processes develop into a set of diverse and complex cognitive procedures when used in parallel and simultaneously. These component skills or attributes include the ability to comprehend and produce written and oral statements describing the interaction of complex variables\",\n",

       " ' SGs',\n",
       " ' and SEGs to promote the learning of psychomotor skills have been implemented in multiple .elds. These .elds include the medical',\n",
       " ' aviation',\n",
       " ' and natural science .elds. Prime among the reasons for the use of these modes of learning is the ability of the students to engage in soft-failure scenarios (Vallett \\n& Annetta',\n",
       " ' \\n2014). Students have the opportunity to routinely engage in multiple attempts and explore as they see .t without the use of actual materials or fear of failure (Lamb \\n& Annetta',\n",
       " ' \\n2013). In addition to options for continuous practice',\n",
       " ' simulations',\n",
       " ' SGs',\n",
       " ' and SEGs provide for a means to control confounding variables within the educational process maximizing on-task learning and re.ective practice. \\n\\n14.7. Dimensionality \\nDimensionality refers to the development of the SG',\n",
       " ' SEG',\n",
       " ' or ES as a two-dimensional or three-dimensional virtual learning envi-ronment. The main characteristics of the three-dimensional envi-ronment are the modeling of the real-world using the XYZ coordinate system. The XYZ coordinate system allows for move-ment and vector development within each axis. A second charac-teristic of dimensionality is the ability of the user to interact and manipulate items within the environment. The major assumption associated with learning in a three-dimensional environment is the learner will be able to transfer the three-dimensional virtual environmental cues and models from the two-dimensional screen back to the three-dimensional real world. Many studies have concluded that this is possible to do so in terms of speci.c cognitive attributes (Chiesa',\n",
       " ' \\nCalati',\n",
       " ' \\n& Serretti',\n",
       " ' \\n2011; Catala',\n",

       " ' \\nPons',\n",
       " ' \\n& \\nJaen',\n",
       " ' \\n2014). With this said',\n",
       " ' there are relatively few studies directly comparing two-dimensional virtual learning envi-ronments to three-dimensional learning environments. In addition',\n",
       " ' current extant studies are inconclusive in answering questions related to the two-dimensional versus three-dimensional leaning environments. There is some evidence that the form of presenta-tion of information mediates the manner in which the information is cognitively encoded (Ownes',\n",

       " ' Khazanchi',\n",
       " ' & Zigurs',\n",
       " ' 2011). \\n15. Independence of effect size \\nThe unit of analysis for this review is the independent sample. Within most of the studies that met our inclusion criteria',\n",
       " ' more than one effect size is obtainable for the sample due to multiple subscales and multiple tests. For example',\n",
       " ' some researchers measured the same construct multiple ways or multiple times. Other researchers employed multiple treatment groups and mul-tiple control groups. Ignoring the dependence between the sample treatment means and comparison means can result in a study having too much weight within the analysis. In those cases in which the effect size lacked independence',\n",
       " ' an average effect size for the study was calculated. In some cases',\n",
       " ' the samples of some subscales and assessments overlapped but lacked or gained a few students so the sample sizes of each dependent effect size varied slightly. In these cases',\n",
       " ' a weighted average effect size was calculated and the .nal sample size used was an average of the sample sizes. Other studies allowed for analysis of differential samples studies with no overlap',\n",
       " ' within these studies',\n",
       " ' each effect size was independent and these were included in the meta-analysis. Studies continuing into a second year in which the design was repeated with an entirely new sample of students were also included as an independent effect size. This repetition results in a second effect size for inclusion within the meta-analysis. Multiple effect sizes do not reduce clus-tering resulting from within study effects on means and variances. This speci.c method of structuring the data does not disallow the possibility of data clustering. \\n16.
